"""The tenant seam — one EventBridge envelope in, one OpenSearch document out.

Everything else in this service is tenant-agnostic. This module is the part that
is allowed to vary, and in the copies this product replaces it was the *only*
part that meaningfully did: comparing the JunctionNet and VIA forwarders line for
line, `application.py` differed in 2 lines of 9 and `repositories.py` in 8 of 51,
while the shaping differed in roughly half its lines.

So the shaping is not code here. It is a declarative field map supplied per
tenant as the `ShapingConfig` stack parameter, and this module is the interpreter
for it. Three tenants, three config files, one deployed artifact.

      "nested":   {"organization_user_context": {"username": "username"}}
    }

Nothing here imports `opensearch-py`, `requests-aws4auth` or `boto3`. That is
checked by `tests/test_shaping_standalone.py`, and it is what keeps the generic
half separable: a tenant supplies JSON, never a dependency.

    An index with no explicit mapping — no index template, nothing in Terraform —
    has OpenSearch infer each field's type from the **first non-null value it ever
    sees**, and that inference is permanent for the life of the index. Where every
    stage writes to one shared index, a single dev event carrying ``"12"`` instead
    of ``12`` maps the field as text, and every ``sum`` over it fails from then on
    — fixable only by a reindex.

    The failure is also silent. ``OpenSearchAppEventsRepository.save_event``
    swallows indexing exceptions, so a mapper conflict discards the **whole event
    document**, not just this field, and raises no alarm.

    So: coerce what is unambiguously an integer, and drop anything else rather than
    let a careless emitter decide the mapping. ``bool`` is excluded on purpose — it
    is an ``int`` subclass in Python, and "True pages" is a bug worth losing, not
